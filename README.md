# Connecting NFT smart contract to a Frontend

This NFT Smart contract was deployed on Sepolia testnet. It inherited from the Openzeppelin interface.

To mint your NFT from this test project, you need to have Metamask connected to your browser and with sepolia eth to pay for gas fees.

Put in the desired address you want to mint the NFT to. (Gas fee will be charged at the address connected to your metamask) Feel free to use this same address or a different for the minting.

I used React library and CSS for the frontend.
